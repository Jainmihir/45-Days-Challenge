## what is kubernetes:- 
-> kubernetes is a container orchistration engine for automating deployment , scaling and management of containerized application.
-> kubernetes is an open-source container management tool which automates container deployment , container scaling & load balancing.
-> it schedules , runs and manages isolated containers which running on virtual/physical/cloud machines.
-> all top cloud provider support kubernetes.

## problems with scaling up the container :-
-> container cannot communicate with each other.
-> autoscaling and load balancing was not possible.
-> containers had to be managed carefully.

## features of kubernetes :-
-> orchisteration (Clustering of any no. of container running on differnt N/W).
-> autoscaling > horizontal, vertical supports
-> auto-healing 
-> load balancing.
-> kubernetes supports hybrid cloud.
-> platform independent (cloud/virtual/physical).
-> health monitors of containers.
-> fault tolerance(NODE, POD failure).
-> Rollback .
-> batch execution.


## kubernetes vs docker swarm :-
# kubenetes :- 
-> complicated and time consuming 
-> it can work with almost all container types like rocket, docker containers.
-> GUI aviaiblable.
-> volumes only shared with containers within same pod.
-> process sheduling to maintain services while updating.
-> support vertical and horizontal autoscaling.

# docker swarm :-
-> fast and easy.
-> work with only docker containers.
-> gui not available.
-> volumes can be shared with the other containers.
-> progressive updates and health monitoring through updates.
-> not support scaling.

## kubernetes master and slave :-
cluster>>master>>node>>POD>>container>>application(microservice).
pod >> smallest unit of kubernetes.

## monolithic and microservices :-
monolithic -> means single service
microservices -> meand mulitiple service.

-> Monolithic applications are a single codebase, while microservices are composed of multiple loosely-coupled services. Monolithic applications typically consist of a client-side UI, a database, and a server-side application. In microservices, each microservice works to accomplish a single feature or business logic
